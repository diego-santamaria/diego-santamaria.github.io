title: About me
---

I am a Senior Software Engineer with 9+ years of experience building backend, data, and AI-driven solutions in production environments. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Systems Engineering and have a strong background in .NET and Python, with hands-on experience across cloud platforms and large-scale data systems.

I currently work on an Innovation team at a U.S. direct-to-consumer insurance company, where I build systems that combine speech-to-text, large language models, and data pipelines to solve real compliance, performance, and operational challenges.

## What I Do

I build backend services and data pipelines that combine data engineering and applied AI to solve operational, compliance, and performance problems in production systems.


## Background

My career began with enterprise backend and integration systems and evolved toward cloud data engineering and applied AI, always with a focus on reliable production software.

## How I Think

I value integrity, ownership, and continuous learning. I prefer clarity over cleverness, and I aim to build systems that are maintainable, observable, and honest about their limitations.

I believe in measuring what matters, questioning assumptions, and choosing the simplest solution that solves the actual problem. I try to be direct and thoughtful, both in code and in communication.

## Why This Page Exists

This is not a blog. There is no content schedule, no newsletter, and no promise of regular updates.

This page exists so that I can be understood. It is a stable reference point for who I am and what I do. If I write something in the future, it will appear here, but only if and when I have something worth writing.

The site is intentionally minimal. It is complete as it is.

## Outside of Work

I enjoy photography, singing, and music.

I volunteer with [Asociación Alegría y Paz](https://alegriaypaz.org), a non-profit organization in Peru that supports educational development and opportunities for young people with limited resources.
