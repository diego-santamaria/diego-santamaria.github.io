# Diego Santamaria

I am a Senior Software Engineer with over 9 years of experience building backend, data, and AI-driven solutions in production environments. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Systems Engineering and have a strong background in .NET and Python, with hands-on experience across cloud platforms and large-scale data systems.

I currently work on an Innovation team at a U.S. direct-to-consumer insurance company, where I build systems that combine speech-to-text, large language models, and data pipelines to solve real compliance, performance, and operational challenges.

## What I Do

My work focuses on backend architecture and implementation, with strong involvement in system design. I build ETL-oriented data pipelines and production systems that process voice, text, and structured data at scale.

Examples of the kinds of projects I have worked on include:

- A compliance detection system that analyzes call transcriptions to identify TCPA-related risks, achieving approximately 94% detection reliability
- A call segment analysis tool that measures agent performance against top performers to surface coaching opportunities
- A real-time AI virtual assistant that handles inbound calls, collects customer information, and routes calls to the appropriate agent
- An AI-powered recommendation system that dynamically selects webpage titles based on user search keywords, with emphasis on low latency
- A reusable framework for calling OpenAI models from Databricks with rate-limit handling, asynchronicity, and throughput optimization

I work primarily with Databricks, Azure OpenAI, Azure, and AWS.


## Background

I started my career in .NET development and progressively moved into data engineering and AI-driven systems. Over the years, I have worked across cloud platforms, built production pipelines, and contributed to systems that run at scale and serve real users.

My education is in Systems Engineering. My trajectory has been shaped by solving practical problems in regulated and high-stakes environments.

## How I Think

I value integrity, ownership, and continuous learning. I prefer clarity over cleverness, and I aim to build systems that are maintainable, observable, and honest about their limitations.

I believe in measuring what matters, questioning assumptions, and choosing the simplest solution that solves the actual problem. I try to be direct and thoughtful, both in code and in communication.

## Why This Page Exists

This is not a blog. There is no content schedule, no newsletter, and no promise of regular updates.

This page exists so that I can be understood. It is a stable reference point for who I am and what I do. If I write something in the future, it will appear here, but only if and when I have something worth writing.

The site is intentionally minimal. It is complete as it is.

## Outside of Work

I enjoy photography, singing, and music.

I volunteer with [Asociación Alegría y Paz](https://alegriaypaz.org), a non-profit organization in Peru that supports educational development and opportunities for young people with limited resources.
